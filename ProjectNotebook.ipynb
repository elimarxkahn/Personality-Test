    "Based on the \"Big Five\" personality traits (extroversion, conscientiousness, openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism), I wrote a personality test. This test gives users a chance to answer 25 total questions from these five categories, and tallies up their points in each category. At the end, it provides them with a sentence explaining their personality in terms of the \"Big Five\" traits, as well as a bar graph so they can see their relative levels of each trait. I based my questions and scoring off of well documented and well tested psychological tests and surveys. I hope that this can give people a chance to understand themselves a little bit better!"
